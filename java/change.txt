FizzBuzz:
Smells: Long Method, comment
refactored--> 
    Long Method: decomposed conditionals to interface PatternMatcher, which is implemented by 3 classes each handling one responsibility.
    Comment: Removed comments as the code was readable.

PlaintextToHTMLConverter:
Smells: comment, large class, long method, switch, duplicate code, and Hidden Dependencies code smell.
Refacoted-->    
    Comment: Removed the comments by modifying the methods. Comments were in line 60-61 and 68-69 and removed them as those methods were readable.
    Long Method: made methods smaller by using enum and for each loop (i.e. basicHtmlEncode)
    Switch case: Replaced all switch cases using the enum
    Hidden Dependencies code smell: I removed global variables as they are undesirable because it directly causes the Hidden Dependencies code smell.
    Duplicate code: Line 51 was a duplicated code, which I resolved using the for loop.
    Deleted method ‘pushACharacterToTheOutput’ as that method wasn’t that much necessary.
